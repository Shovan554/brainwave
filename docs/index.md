# Welcome to BrainWave

BrainWave is an educational social media platform designed for students with shorter attention spans, offering a microlearning experience in a focused and collaborative environment. The platform allows users to connect with peers, promote projects and clubs, and learn directly from their own teachers. A classroom feature will be integrated, enabling users to create classes or groups where they can manage assignments, share study materials, and engage in group chats with the entire class. BrainWave filters content to ensure that only educational material is shared, eliminating distractions like reels and non-educational content.

## Key Features

### 1. Chat, Reels, Posts, and Accounts
BrainWave offers a familiar social media experience with chat, reels, posts, and customizable accounts, providing a smooth and intuitive user interface.

### 2. Club Accounts
Create or join **club accounts**, accessible to all members through a single link. Each club will have a dedicated **Club Info** page listing all members, and clubs can receive sponsorships via integrated **PayPal** support.

### 3. Project Portfolios
Each user has a personalized project portfolio, showcasing projects with GitHub links and detailed descriptions. This serves as a professional portfolio to highlight individual accomplishments.

### 4. Classroom Feature
BrainWave includes a **classroom feature** where groups are created for each class. Professors act as admins, and the feature allows for:
- Assignment management
- Class-based to-dos and reminders
- A **calendar** tracking assignments and custom reminders

### 5. Content Filtering
All content is filtered to ensure it aligns with educational goals, eliminating inappropriate material and distractions (e.g., explicit content or non-educational reels).

### 6. Microlearning
Embrace the power of **microlearning** with short, 3-minute videos designed for focused learning. Longer educational videos are available as a separate option.

### 7. Content Preference Algorithm
A smart algorithm (likely similar to **EdgeRank**) will tailor content to individual users based on engagement and preferences, helping them discover the most relevant educational material.
