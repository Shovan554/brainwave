# BrainWave Documentation

## Frameworks Used

### 1. Frontend
- **React**: The primary frontend framework for building the user interface of the BrainWave app.
  - **React Hooks**: For managing state and lifecycle methods efficiently within functional components.
  - **React Router**: For handling navigation between different pages.

### 2. Backend (Future Consideration)
- **Node.js (Optional)**: We may consider using Node.js with Express for handling the backend API and communication with the database.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database system used to store all user data, posts, clubs, assignments, and other platform content.

### 3. API Communication
- **REST API**: The backend communicates with the frontend using RESTful APIs to handle data requests and responses.

### 4. State Management
- **React Context API or Redux**: For managing application state efficiently across the app.
  
### 5. Authentication
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: To secure API endpoints and manage user authentication and sessions.

### 6. Storage
- **LocalStorage / SessionStorage**: Used to securely store JWT tokens on the client side for user authentication.
